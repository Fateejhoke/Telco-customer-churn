# Telco-customer-churn analysis
# OVERVIEW
This is a telco customer churn dataset analyzed thoroughly with Microsoft Excel. This report presents key insights derived from data analysis, along with recommendations to boost customer retention.
 # OBJECTIVES 
The goal of this analysis is to gain insight about the services and identify the proportion of customers who leave the service provider within a set time period. This can be broken down into:
•	Explore the contact type and the internet service options.
•	Examine the relationship between senior citizen customers and non-citizen customers.
•	Examine the relationship between the rate of churn of multiple-line and single-line users.
•	Examine the tenure of the customer before churning
# DATA SOURCE
The data for this analysis was collected from Kaggle, which provides a comprehensive dataset about Telco's customer churn.
# DATA TRANSFORMATION
The dataset was converted into a table, transformed into a power query editor, categorized the tenure column based on the number of months spent, renamed some columns, and ensured effective cleanliness, followed by analysis and visualization using Microsoft Excel

# FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION
1.	This analysis revealed that the telecom firm has the least number of senior citizens as customers. To capitalize on future success, this can be done by creating clear communication and personalized support to meet their needs.
2.	The majority of customers stay with the company longer. To increase client retention, more loyal and engaging programs could be developed.
3.	Fiber optics are mostly utilized for internet, and the great majority of clients sign monthly contracts.
4.	The company has an equal number of genders. This indicates that gender does not have an effect on the rate of customer churn.
5.	The rate of churn for customers who use multiple lines is comparable to that of consumers who simply subscribe to the company. This emphasized that while the services rendered are good, they can be enhanced through the use of a special offer strategy to lower churn.
6.	Overall, the majority of the customers stayed with the telecommunications company. However, to prevent churn, improvements can be made in the area of payment methods, especially with senior citizens and certain contract types.
